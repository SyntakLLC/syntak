                    These Terms and Conditions govern your use of the Pixel Maps mobile application (the "App"), a freemium service developed by Amaan Ali. By downloading or using the App, you agree to be bound by these terms.
                </p>

                <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>
                    All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights associated with the App remain the sole property of the developer. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or create derivative works based on the App or any of its components without explicit written permission.
                </p>

                <h2>Modifications to the App</h2>
                <p>
                    We reserve the right to modify, update, or discontinue the App at any time without prior notice. We may also introduce new features or implement charges for certain services. If pricing changes are introduced, we will provide advance notice before they take effect.
                </p>

                <h2>Device Security</h2>
                <p>
                    You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device. We strongly advise against modifying your device through jailbreaking, rooting, or similar methods, as this may compromise device security and expose it to malicious software, potentially affecting the App's functionality.
                </p>

                <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>
                    The App integrates with external services, each subject to their own terms and conditions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Expo</li>
                    <li>RevenueCat</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Connectivity and Data Usage</h2>
                <p>
                    Certain features of the App require an active internet connection. You are responsible for ensuring adequate connectivity and for any charges incurred through your mobile data provider. We are not liable for reduced functionality due to lack of internet access or exhausted data allowances.
                </p>

                <h2>Updates</h2>
                <p>
                    To ensure optimal performance and security, you may be required to download updates when they become available. Failure to install updates may result in limited functionality or inability to use the App.
                </p>

                <h2>Termination</h2>
                <p>
                    We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the App at any time, without prior notice, for any reason, including violation of these terms.
                </p>

                <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
                <p>
                    The App is provided "AS IS" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not guarantee that the App will be error-free, uninterrupted, or free of harmful components.
                </p>

                <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>
                    To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App.
                </p>

                <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    We may revise these Terms and Conditions at any time. Updated terms will be posted on this page and become effective immediately upon publication. Continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of any modified terms.
